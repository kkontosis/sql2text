The library `libsql2text` relies on `libretranse` which is the runtime
library that parses and runs programs written in `retranse' - a language 
based on regular expressions - which is part of the same project.
The libsql2text library is also the basis for the `sql2textfs` project.
This library reads tables from any database given a connection string
and retrieves the table rows in a representation of lines of text.
The text lines are tab-delimited to separate the data columns.
This library is also capable of parsing lines of text and of converting
back to tables and also modifies the database tables with entries
of lines of text as data.
The configuration file for this library is essential since much of the
convertion functionality lies there and each database type requires
a special configuration file. This file is written in retranse.
For the database API the library uses `cppdb` which a the library for
abstract database access used in the `cppcms` project. The cppdb
library has an interface with `unixodbc` among others which is an ODBC
driver that supports many databases. The cppdb layer complies with the 
minimum required interface for this project and has simple C++ interface
making the source code of libsql2text more reliable.
This package contains the library and a program that demonstrates and runs 
all the library functions from the command line.
