libsql2text INSTALLATION

An easy way to build libsql2text is to download and use the `sql2textbuilder.sh` 
script, which can be found in the `sql2textfs' project site.
It handles downloading and building the special dependencies automatically.
The following instructions give details for a manual installation.

1. Requirements
================================================================================

libsql2text currently compiles only on POSIX systems.
It has been tested in a Ubuntu Linux 9.04.

The programs needed to compile libsql2text are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	g++
	make
	libpcre development package
	libpcre++ development package
	unixodbc development package
	libmysqlclient development package
	libsqlite3 development package
	libpq development package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	libcppdb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	libretranse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that in different systems, the package names may vary.

The library libcppdb is part of the cppcms project and has separate
installation instructions. See also: http://cppcms.com

The library libretranse is part of the same project as libsql2text
and has separate installation instructions.

In order to build libsql2text, the projects
	cppdb
	retranse

need to be placed in the parent directory of the one that contains libsql2text
with the exact names `cppdb` and `retranse`.
Listing the parent directory should look like this:

	cppdb
	retranse
	sql2text

Before building sql2text make sure that cppdb and retranse have been built.


2. Installation
================================================================================

Before building it is necessary to have an sql2text directory side by side 
with its pre-compiled dependencies as described above.
Go to the sql2text directory and type:

	make

The libsql2text library and the sql2text example program will be both compiled.
After that, if you wish to install the library into /usr/local type:

	sudo make install

and the libsql2text libraries and headers together with the configuration
files in /etc/sql2text will be installed.


3. Unstalling libsql2text
================================================================================

To remove the libraries from /usr/local go to the source code directory
and type:

	sudo make uninstall
